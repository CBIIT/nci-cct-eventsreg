I wrote to the head of Biochemistry, a very famous biochemist named Jesse Greenstein, and Jesse wrote me back saying that what I didn't understand is how hot it was in Washington in the summertime. There was no air conditioning at the NIH at that time, and he said he personally never spends summers here, that he spent his summers in Berkeley. And he thought it would be nice if I did the same thing. So that was my first attempt to get to the NCI.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Then after I graduated, I interned in medicine in Boston and then had a year of pathology residency at a hospital in New York City. At this point, the Korean War was raging, and my draft board was urging me to accept a com mission in the Army or someplace so I could serve. They told me at the end of my residency that was all the deferment I would get, and I found out Alan about the Commissioned Corps of the Public Health Service which could be used in lieu of going to Korea in the Army, so I signed up for that.

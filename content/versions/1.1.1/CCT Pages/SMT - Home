<h2>Scientific Management Training (SMT)</h2>

<p>The intramural program of the NCI is one of the largest centers for cancer research in the world, with approximately 200 Principal Investigators and 500 Postdoctoral Fellows. &nbsp;While outstanding scientific research is conducted at NCI, many of the scientists who go on to lead their own laboratories have few management skills.&nbsp; The Scientific Management Training (SMT) course focuses on personnel and project management.&nbsp; In the art of supervision section, it is emphasized that each personnel is unique and should be treated properly to achieve desired outcomes.&nbsp; In the organization section, the development of successful teams with delegated authority is needed to complete an organizational mission.&nbsp; The goal of the SMT course is to develop the skills needed to successfully lead a scientific research laboratory. The participation of NCI PIs and Fellows, who need to develop scientific management skills is encouraged.</p>

<p><strong>NOTE:</strong>&nbsp; Registration is limited to 50 students.</p>

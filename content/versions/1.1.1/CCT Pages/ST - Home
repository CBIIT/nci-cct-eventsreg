<h2>Statistical Tutorial (ST)</h2>

<p>Recent advances in cancer biology have resulted in the need for increased statistical analysis of research data.&nbsp; ST is designed as a follow up to Statistical Analysis of Research Data (SARD) held in April 2018.&nbsp; The tutorial will apply the general principles of statistical analysis of research data including descriptive statistics, z- and t-tests of means and mean differences, simple and multiple linear regression, ANOVA tests, and Chi-Squared distribution.</p>

<p>The tutorial will be held on Monday May 14, 2018 from 1-4 p.m. at the National Institutes of Health (Bldg. 45) in Rooms (F1, F2).&nbsp; The participation of NIH clinical and postdoctoral fellows who need to conduct statistical analysis of research data is encouraged.</p>

<h2>The NCI Center for Cancer Training announces a course for postdoctoral or clinical fellows: Statistical Analysis of Research Data (SARD)</h2>

<p>Recent advances in cancer biology have resulted in the need for increased statistical analysis of research data. The Statistical Analysis of Research Data (SARD) course will be held on January 8-9, 2019 from 9 a.m.-5 p.m. at the National Institutes of Health's Natcher Conference Center, Balcony B on the Bethesda Campus. SARD is designed to provide an overview on the general principles of statistical analysis of research data. The course will be taught by Paul W. Thurman of Columbia University. The first day will feature univariate data analysis, including descriptive statistics, probability distributions, one- and two-sample inferential statistics. The second day will feature bivariate data analysis including bivariate statistics, linear regression non-parametric tools and goodness of fit tests. The participation of NIH clinical and postdoctoral fellows is encouraged.</p>

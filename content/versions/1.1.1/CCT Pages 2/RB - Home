<h2>Redox Biology (RB)</h2>

<p>Recent advances in the biochemistry of redox-active species and radicals are beginning to be translated into improvements in prevention and treatment of cancer. Traditionally, these reactive species such as superoxide, hydrogen peroxide and nitric oxide (NO) are toxic; however, NO is useful in the treatment of angina and cardiovascular disease. Also, NO is involved in cancer tumor angiogenesis and apoptosis of cancer cells. The Redox Biology course will overview how redox-active species and radicals are generated, their effects on the cellular and physiological level, and how they alter carcinogenesis, angiogenesis and proliferation in animal models of cancer. NO alters patient imaging profiles and response to cancer therapy.</p>

<p>This course is designed to provide an overview of the general principles of NO biochemistry, cell biology, signal transduction,&nbsp;physiology, carcinogenesis, chemoprevention, angiogenesis, therapy, immunology and epidemiology. The participation of NIH postdoctoral and clinical fellows interested in redox biology is encouraged.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>There is no registration fee for this course.</strong></p>

<h2>Certificate</h2>

<p>Participants who register for this course will receive a certificate of completion after attending the lectures and completing an online final examination.</p>

<h2>Location</h2>

<p>The Redox Biology course is usually held on Tuesday afternoons (4:00 – 6:00 PM) on the Bethesda Campus (Bldg. 50, Rooms 1227/1233). This course is also&nbsp; videocast to NCI-Frederick (Bldg. 549, Room A).</p>

<p>The course consists of two 1-hour lectures.&nbsp; Each session will have a 50-minute lecture with ample time for discussion and analysis. A handout for each lecture will be distributed on site.</p>

<h2>Related Training Opportunities</h2>

<p>This course is part of an ongoing training curriculum for NCI clinical and postdoctoral fellows. Each fall CCR offers the “Translational Research in Clinical Oncology (TRACO)” course, hosted by Dr. Terry Moody. Another course, "Demystifying Medicine" is held each spring. This course provides 2 hours of lecture each week (January – May) and is hosted by Dr. Irvin M. Arias.
